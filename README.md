HDvideodownload — Frontend-only (GitHub Pages) — Premium UI (Option B)

How to use:
1. Upload files to a GitHub repository (Add file -> Upload files).
2. Make sure files are in repository root: index.html, style.css, script.js, logo.svg, login.html, signup.html
3. Go to repository Settings -> Pages -> Source -> Select branch 'main' and folder '/ (root)' -> Save
4. After a minute your site will be available at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Notes:
- This is a frontend-only demo. It does not download YouTube/Instagram/Facebook videos (server-side download is required for that).
- Login/Signup uses localStorage for demo purposes.
- Local file preview uses browser's object URL and does not upload files anywhere.
